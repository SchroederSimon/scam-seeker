Scam Seeker

Scam Seeker is a web application that uses the Twitter, Reddit, and News APIs to search for keywords provided by users and determine if they are related to any scams.
The application works by searching for the provided keywords and analyzing the sentiment of the results to determine if they seem suspicious.

For example, if a user searches for "Generaci√≥n Zoe," the application will analyze the results and provide a "sentiment" thermometer that indicates the likelihood 
of the search being related to a scam. The application will also display the tweets, news articles, and posts used to determine the sentiment, so the user can check 
for themselves.

The project is under construction (waiting for API acces from twitter)
